====test====
When I send a request to an operation
And I force the response by adding __code to the path (ie http://localhost:4010/pets/123?__code=200)
And this operation has no response with such code defined
And this operation does not have default response defined
Then I should get back a response with 404 status code
And the response's payload should describe the error
====spec====

  /todos:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
