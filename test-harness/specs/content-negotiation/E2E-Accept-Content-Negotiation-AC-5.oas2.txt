====test====
When I send a request to an operation with Accept header containing application/*
And this operation can produce responses with content-type matching application/* (application/json, application/xml)
Then I should get back a response with the first content-type that matched application/*
And this response should have 200 status code

  /todos:
    get:
      produces:
        - application/json
        - application/xml
      responses:
