====test====
When I send a request to an operation with Accept header containing multiple types.
And this operation can produce a response that matches one of them.
And matched response's Content-Type is not first one from Accept header.
Then I should get back a response matching that format
And this response should have Content-Type header matching that format
And this response should have 200 status code
