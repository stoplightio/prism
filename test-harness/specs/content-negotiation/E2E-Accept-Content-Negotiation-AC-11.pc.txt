====test====
When I send a request to an operation with Accept header containing application/json;q=0.8, application/xml, text/plain;q=0.5
And this operation does not produce a response with either the content-type of application/json or application/xml
Then I should get back a response with the content-type of text/plain
And this response should have 200 status code
