====test====
Prism generates dynamic values for schema when no static examples are provided.

Given there are examples defined for an operation
And this operation can produce application/json response
And this operation response defines a JSON Schema (schema field)
And I make a request to this operationAnd the request has Accept header of application/json
And I add __dynamic=true to the query path
Then I should get a response with dynamically generated JSON as payload
====spec====
openapi: 3.0.0
paths:
  /path
    get:
      summary: Your GET endpoint
      responses:
        '200':

          content:
            application/json:
              examples:
                example-1:
                  value: 123
              schema:
                  type: object
