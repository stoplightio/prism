====test====
When I send a request to an operation
And this operation has a complex schema (with no primitives)
And the returned content type is a text/html string
Then I should get back a 500 error because we do not know how to serialise it
====spec====
openapi: "3.0.1"
paths:
  /:
    get:
      responses:
        200:
          content:
            text/html:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  name:
                    type: string
                    example: Clark
                  surname:
                    type: string
                    example: Kent
