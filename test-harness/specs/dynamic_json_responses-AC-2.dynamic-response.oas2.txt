====test====
Prism generates dynamic values for schema when no static examples are provided.

Given there are examples defined for an operation
And this operation can produce application/json response
And this operation response defines a JSON Schema (schema field)
And I make a request to this operationAnd the request has Accept header of application/json
And I add __dynamic=true to the query path
Then I should get a response with dynamically generated JSON as payload
====spec====
