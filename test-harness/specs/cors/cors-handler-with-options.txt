====test====
If I run Prism with a document
And the CORS support is enabled
And I do a request with OPTIONS as verb
I should still get the defined response in the spec
====spec====
openapi: 3.0.0
paths:
  /test:
    options:
      responses:
        '200':
          description: OK
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  test:
                    type: string
                    default: OPTIONS worked
====server====
mock -p 4010 ${document}
====command====
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://localhost:4010/test
====expect====
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

{"test":"OPTIONS worked"}
