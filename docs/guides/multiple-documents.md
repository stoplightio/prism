# Serving Multiple OpenAPI Documents

A single Prism instance serves one OpenAPI document, but serving multiple documents is possible by running multiple Prism instances on different documents, then serving their content using a reverse Proxy. 

## Preparing configuration files

Depending on your needs, you might have a `docker-compose.yaml` file like this:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  proxy:
    image: nginx:alpine
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
    ports:
      - '8080:80'
    depends_on:
      - prism_1
      - prism_2
  prism_1:
    image: stoplight/prism:3
    command: >
      mock -p 4010 --host 0.0.0.0
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v2.0/yaml/petstore.yaml
  prism_2:
    image: stoplight/prism:3
    command: >
      mock -p 4010 --host 0.0.0.0
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml
```

And the corresponding `nginx.conf` file:

```
worker_processes auto;

events {
  worker_connections 512;
}

http {
  server {
    listen 80;

    location /app_1 {
      rewrite ^/app_1/(.*) /$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://prism_1:4010/;
    }

    location /app_2 {
      rewrite ^/app_2/(.*) /$1 break;
      proxy_pass http://prism_2:4010/;
    }
  }
}
```

This configuration will allow access to the first Prism instance on `localhost:8080/app_1` and the second instance on `localhost:8080/app_2` endpoint.
Also, please mind that the provided `nginx.conf` only serves illustrative purposes and hence should not be considered complete nor production-ready.

## Running the cluster

Let's first place the aforementioned files under the same directory - here `prism-multi-example`.

```
prism-multi-example
├── docker-compose.yaml
└── nginx.conf
```

With the files in place, you can run (from under `prism-multi-example/`): `docker-compose up`.
After a second, you should be set up with two Prism instances serving different OAS documents.

## Testing the cluster

If you used `nginx.conf` configuration provided in this document, you should now have two endpoints available:

```
1. http://localhost:8080/app_1
2. http://localhost:8080/app_2
```

You can now try these out by issuing:

```
1. curl localhost:8080/app_1/pets
2. curl localhost:8080/app_2/pets
```

At this point, the responses should be given back without issues.

## Adding more documents

You can easily extend the cluster by adding more nodes to `docker-compose.yaml`.
Under `services`, you can add:

```yaml
prism_3:
  image: stoplight/prism:3
  command: >
    mock -p 4010 --host 0.0.0.0
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/master/examples/v3.0/petstore.yaml
```

To make the new node accessible from the proxy, please also adjust `nginx.conf`:

```
location /app_3 {
  rewrite ^/app_3/(.*) /$1 break;
  proxy_pass http://prism_3:4010/;
}
```
